<div class = "transbox">
<p><b>I was born in Naples, Florida. My family moved to Texas a year after I was born, so I was raised in Texas for three years. Two years later we moved to Miami, Florida. I lived here ever since.</b></p>
<p><b>I have two brothers, one being a lawyer, and another joining the Navy. They encouraged me to study anything related to technology. I took their advice and later found out about coding.</b></p>
